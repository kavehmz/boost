Being fast is important for any developer.

Not to produce more but to have more free time between tasks. To have more time to think and find simpler and better solution for next action.

This repository contains part of my setup to help me doing stuff like:


```
$ gg server    # searhing for content
-1 cmd.pl:10     system('ssh root@' . get_server('kv'));
-2 cmd.pl:14     system('ssh root@' . get_server($ARGV[1]));
$ ec 1         # and now file is open in my editor

$ ff bash      # searching for files
-1 ./bash_profile
-2 ./git-completion.bash

$ sf ./bash_profile # sync the file to the place I need.

$ sh myho      # connecting to where I want with typing few letters
1) myhost01.kaveh.me
2) myhost02.kaveh.me

# My git commands. You can guess what each one does
$ g f
$ g d
$ g dw
$ g cm -am 'my comment'
$ g b -l
$ g m origin/master
$ g p

```

Dont forget to pick a fast editor for your taste and optimize your desktop.
